# probabilistic-graph-benchmarks

This repository contains probabilistic graphs that I use to benchmark projected weighted model counters and other probabilistic reasonning tools.
You can find in the `graphs` directory all the source data-set from which I create the instances; if you use any of these in your work please use the appropriate citations:
